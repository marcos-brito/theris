# Theris

Have you ever dreamed about changing the color scheme for all your favorite applications with a single command? Well, I haven't. But either
way, I got you.

Theris is what you might call a theme manager. It's similar to [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) in some aspects, but with more focus on changing color schemes
instead of creating.

There is also a handful of similar projects, but it took me a 5 minutes research on reddit and github to find them. By then it was too late.

## Why

Because every time I dare to think on changing themes for my rices I remember that I need to edit a bunch of files and just end up
changing my mind instead.

# Usage

The docs are hosted [here](https://marcos-brito.github.io/theris/), but you can also read it from the repository (see [docs](./docs/src/README.md)). It's a quick read, don't worry.

# Theris

Have you ever dreamed about changing the colorscheme for all your favorite applications with a single command? Well, I didn't. But either
way, I got you.

Theris is what you might call a theme manager. It's similar to [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) in some aspects, but with more focus on changing colorschemes
instead of creating.

There is also a handful of similar projects, but it took me a 5 minutes research on reddit and github to find them. It was too late.

## Why

Because everytime I dare to think on changing themes for my rices I remember that I need to edit a bunch of files and just end up
changing my mind instead. [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) seems a good idea, but I have some issues with it:

- It's python
- I didn't wrote it
- Weird CLI

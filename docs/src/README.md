# Introduction

Theris is a tool that helps manage color schemes for different applications. It really shines when used with
software that has a file based configuration.

Unfortunately it's impossible to make this in a "configuration free" manner as each application has it's own settings. Theris requires some work
to be done but nothing too fancy. It can take few minutes and some minor changes on your environment to make it work with everything.

You should see [Configuration](/config.md) to learn more about it. In short you will need to:

- Create some template files
- Define your color schemes
- Tell theris how to apply the theme

Here is a little preview for you:
